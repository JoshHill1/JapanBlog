      <h1>Tokyo</h1>
      <p>This trip took place on July 28th, 2023. It was the first vacation my family and I had in a while; so I had not a clue on what to expect. The time difference, navigation, and foreign language was all new to me. But the 7 to 8 days that I experienced there was something not many people could say they've done.</p>

      <p>The flight itself was cool - nothing unusual besides how long it took. The flight was about 10 hours and went by quicker than I thought. I had my computer to play games/do some work, got fed, slept through a movie, and talked to my sister to pass time.</p>

      <p>Once we landed, it didn't really hit me that we were in Japan just yet. It wasn't till later when I saw ads in foreign language talking about a Pokemon World Champion and saw their artwork on an ad. Even then it didn't hit me, though. It <i>did</i> hit me when we went to a subway station to get to our hotel.</p>

      <p>This picture captures the moment when it hit me that I am a foreigner in this beautiful country. I always wanted to go to Tokyo, Japan ever since I was a kid, so it was fascinating to see that I was finally in this country that I only heard and seen so little about.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, through my dads line of work, he has a high status with Marriott hotels, so we stayed at the aloft hotel. I didn't get a picture of the room partly because of its regular ol' hotel look, but it did have a nice view of the sunrise with a main street off to the side.</p>
      <!-- maybe show a pic of the sunrise but also show vid of the active street -->
      <p>When we got to the hotel, we got ready right away to go out and explore the city. We went to the Muji market and got a warm savery croissant filled with red bean paste. It was really cool to see this market and to see how they display... just their groceries.</p>

      <p>It was cool to see all the other stuff they had in the store like their clothes and other small things. I even got a small notepad that was the size of my wallet so I was able to fit it in my pocket and whip it out to jot something down whenever. It also gave me the opportunity to try and use their self check-out machine.</p>

      <p>After shopping around, we went down to the main floor and saw this small booth open where we got to try this float with melon soda and vanilla ice cream on top</p>
      <!-- Show video or pic of the booth -->
      <p>The ice cream itself was different from American vanilla ice cream. It had more of that dairy, milky taste that tasted natural; and the soda was nothing like we have in the U.S. It tasted like the hispanic soda Inca Cola but had a smooth aftertaste of that green melon flavor.</p>
      <p>After that, we were back outside walking around; taking in the scenery of it all. It really is completely foreign to see people driving on the opposite side of the street, not to mention that you also walk on the left side of the sidewalk, too.</p>
      <img src="./Images/street1.jpg" alt="Showing the streets of Japan.">
      <p>It's also worth mentioning how I didn't notice any cracks in the roads or sidewalk, which is common to have in the U.S. I wonder what the reason(s) are even with the fact that there is always construction going on throughout the city. Does it have to do with the fact that no one litters like we do in the U.S? Or that we just don't make our street cement like they do? Could it be because they don't eat and walk either? Ok that one is a joke but it's true! It is rude to eat and walk in Japan! It's part of their culture for people to find a place to sit down or stand to eat their food as opposed to eating in a public setting.</p>
      <p>After walking around for some time, it was time to have a meal that I will never forget. Close to our hotel, there was a street that primarily had an array of ramen shops. We took our time to scope out what was looking tasty and then got in line.</p>
      <p>Something that I've seen throughout all the places we've been to in Japan, is that the places are rather small. Something I noticed while scoping out to eat was that there were regular familys that would wait in line with their kids, and then when seats would open up, only part of the family would go inside and start eating their food while the other half would have to still wait for more people to leave. 
      <br>Luckily, for us, we went to a place that had a table to fit all four of us so that we could all eat together. But we did have to wait in line for people to leave and free up space. What made this meal so memorable was the fact that I <i>love</i> ramen. Especially spicy ramen. So, when I saw that they offered ramen in a spicy broth with egg and pork, I knew that's what I wanted. That bowl of ramen was an experience I've never had before. Even having ramen again in Japan, it was something about the creamy broth and the perfect spice level that made the dish so memorable. By the end of our dinner we were all tired after a good mean so went to our hotel and went to sleep.
